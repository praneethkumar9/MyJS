# Quick Sort 
- Divide & Conquer Strategy 
- Space Complexity :- O(1)      ( In place algorithm ) 
- Time complexity  :- O(nlogn)  ( average case scenerio ) , O(n^2)  ( worst case scenerio )

  - By using randomized verison of quick sort , there is high probability of getting O(nlogn) time complexity .

   - So therefore quick sort is the efficient among all sort algorithm

   - Also most languages uses quick sort as their default sort strategy

# Merge Sort

- Divide & Conquer Strategy 
- Space Complexity :- O(n)      ( Not In place algorithm ) 
- Time complexity  :- O(nlogn)  ( worst case scenerio )

    Since it is not IN place alogithm , it takes more space . So even its worst cases scenerio is O(nlogn) , quick sort is preferred.
