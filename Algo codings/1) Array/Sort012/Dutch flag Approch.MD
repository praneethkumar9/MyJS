1. Take intial values of low , mid , high as below
         low= 0 , mid=0 ,high= arrayLength-1
2. Iterate until mid becomes greater than high
3. While iterating , check the values at mid pointer & do below action for respective value
4.  If mid points to 0
       then  swap values between mid & low and increment both low & mid by 1
5.  If mid points to 1
       increment mid by 1
6.  If mid points to 2
       then swap values between mid & high and decrement high by 1


By the end of the iteration , array will be sorted
