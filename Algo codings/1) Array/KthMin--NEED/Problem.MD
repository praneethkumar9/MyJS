Problem Description: Given an array A[] of n elements and a positive integer K, find the Kth smallest element in the array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

For Example :

Input : A[] = {10, 3, 6, 9, 2, 4, 15, 23}, K = 4

Output: 6

Input : A[] = {5, -8, 10, 37, 101, 2, 9}, K = 6

Output: 37

Possible follow-up questions to ask the interviewer:-

1. Do we know something about the range of the numbers in the array? No, they can be arbitrary integers.
2. Are the array elements necessarily positive? No, they can be positive, negative, or zero.
3. What if K is greater than the size of the array? (Ans: It is guaranteed that 1 ≤ K ≤ n)
4. Can the original array be modified? (Ans: Sure)
