Same as quick select algorithm followed for kth smallest but here we will calculate k value from input given for largest

 * Above alogorithm is quick select to get kth smallest item in array
 * So in the function , we made relation equation so that k will become value respect to the smallest 
 * Ex :-  In an array , [10, 3, 6, 9, 2, 4, 15, 23] , 4th largest item = 5th smallest item
 * Below is the relation equation k = N-k+1
 * N: array length
 * k:  4 as above - as its need 4th largest
