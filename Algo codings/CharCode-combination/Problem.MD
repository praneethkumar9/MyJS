Code Generation

If a=1, b=2, c=3,….z=26. Given a string, find all possible codes that string can generate. Give a count of the possible codes at the output.

Input : 1123
Output : 5
The codes are  : aabc,kbc,alc,aaw, kw 

Explanation
For example: Input: “1123″. You need to general all valid alphabet codes from this string.
Output: 5

> Possible Codewords are: aabc (a = 1, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3) kbc (since k is 11, b = 2, c= 3) alc (a = 1, l = 12, c = 3)
