Given an arary of distinct elements . The task is to find triplets in the array whose sum is zero

Input : arr = [0,-1,2,-3,1]
Output : [[0,-1,1],[2,-3,1]]

Explanation : The triplets with zero sum are 
0 + -1  + 1 = 0
2 + -3  + 1 = 0

Input : arr = [1,-2,1,0,5]
Output : [[1,-2,1]]

Explanation : The triplets with zero sum are 
1 + -2 + 1 = 0
